# Real-Time Object Identifier
# Overview

This project leverages the **YOLOv8** (You Only Look Once) pre-trained model to ensure real-time object detection by highlighting potential objects from user webcam view.

# Technology Stack

Python Â· OpenCV Â· YOLOv8  

# Features

- Real-time object detection via webcam  
- Pre-trained YOLOv8 model for high accuracy  
- Live structural overlays indicating detected objects  
- Clean and modular codebase for easy scalability
